# Algorithms

This repository contains code and explanations in support of my own learning about algorithms.

My primary learning resources have been Steven Skiena's [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) and his associated [lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX32N0fVIyvn7ipWKNGmwpp). I discovered these resources via [Bradfield School of Computer Science's](https://bradfieldcs.com/) site [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms).
